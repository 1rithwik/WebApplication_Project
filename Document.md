Project Overview
The Car Tire Service Project is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for customers seeking tire-related services. It includes functionalities for managing tire services, customer bookings, and an administrative dashboard for service management. This project aims to streamline the process of booking tire services, enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.

System Architecture
The project follows a three-tier architecture comprising:

Frontend: Built with Angular, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface for customers and administrators.
Backend: Developed using Spring Boot, serving as a RESTful API to handle business logic and data processing.
Database: Utilizes MySQL to store all relevant data, including user information, services, bookings, and payments.
Key Components
1. Database Design
The database structure is crucial for storing and managing data efficiently. The following tables are essential for this project:

Users Table: Stores user details, including usernames, passwords (hashed), roles (Admin or Customer), and timestamps for account creation. This allows for user authentication and role-based access control.

Services Table: Contains information about the tire services offered, including service names, descriptions, pricing, and availability status. This table helps customers view and select services.

Bookings Table: Manages customer bookings, linking users to the services they request. It includes booking dates, status (e.g., Confirmed, Completed), and foreign keys referencing the user and service tables.

Payments Table: Records payment information associated with bookings, including amounts, payment dates, and statuses (Paid or Unpaid). This table facilitates payment tracking for services rendered.

2. Backend Development
The backend, implemented in Spring Boot, handles all server-side logic and interacts with the database. Key elements include:

Controllers: Serve as the entry points for client requests. Each controller is responsible for handling requests related to a specific domain (e.g., user management, service handling, booking processing).

Services: Contain the business logic of the application. These classes implement the core functionalities, such as creating a booking, updating service information, or processing payments.

Repositories: Interfaces that facilitate database operations using Spring Data JPA. These repositories enable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database tables.

Security: Employs Spring Security to manage user authentication and authorization. It ensures that only authorized users can access specific functionalities based on their roles.

3. Frontend Development
The frontend is developed using Angular, providing a rich user interface for both customers and administrators. Key features include:

User Interface: A responsive design that allows users to navigate through available services, view service details, and make bookings seamlessly.

Components: Modular components represent different parts of the application, such as service listings, booking forms, and user authentication interfaces.

Routing: Manages navigation within the application, allowing users to move between various pages, such as the homepage, service details, and booking management.

Forms: Utilizes Angular's reactive forms or template-driven forms to handle user inputs for service requests, registrations, and bookings.

4. Features and Functionality
User Registration and Authentication: Customers can create accounts and log in to access personalized features. Admin users have elevated privileges for managing the application.

Service Management: Admins can add, update, or delete tire services, enabling dynamic management of offerings based on availability and demand.

Booking System: Customers can select tire services, choose dates and times, and submit booking requests. The system manages booking statuses to keep users informed.

Payment Processing: Facilitates payments for booked services, allowing customers to pay online or track payment statuses.

Admin Dashboard: Provides a centralized interface for administrators to manage services, view booking details, and monitor user activities.

Notifications and Alerts (optional): Alerts for booking confirmations, reminders, and updates can enhance user experience.

Deployment
The final step involves deploying both the backend and frontend applications:

Backend Deployment: The Spring Boot application can be hosted on platforms like AWS, Heroku, or a dedicated server. Configuration for connecting to the MySQL database must be ensured.

Frontend Deployment: The Angular application can be deployed on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting, making it accessible to users.

Conclusion
The Car Tire Service Project combines SQL, Spring Boot, and Angular to create a comprehensive application for managing tire services. With a well-structured database, a robust backend, and an interactive frontend, the project aims to enhance customer experience while providing administrators with the tools needed to manage operations efficiently.
